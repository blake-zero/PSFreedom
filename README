PSFreedom - PS3 Jailbreak linux kernel
by KaKaRoTo

----
This linux kernel module should work on the N900 (RX51 machine).
It uses the musb driver to access the address of the usb and modify it.

If you want to port this, have a look at psfreedom_machine.c and implement the
missing functions for your device. Make it compile-time #ifdef and modify
the Makefile.

To compile, type 'make' inside scratchbox.
